# Proteus: Gemini Project Memories

## Core UX Principles
- **Optionality is Key**: New features, especially specialized ones like "The Payload" (Drug Encapsulation), must be strictly optional. 
- **User Control**: Never force complex simulation parameters or extra molecules on the user unless they explicitly request them via flags or configuration.
- **UX First**: Always prioritize a clean, understandable interface and output over feature bloating.

## Project Evolution
- Initial implementation focused on automated SMILES-to-MD pipeline.
- Added Ovito integration for high-quality, color-coded GIF visualization.
- Roadmap includes Web Interface, AI Prediction, and Optional Payload simulation.
